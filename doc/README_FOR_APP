== iBoard 4

iBoard4 is a new start from scratch using modern rails patterns and gems.

It's also a try to do a very clean framework for the time when we'll port iBoard3 to the next level.
At the Moment iBoard3 is the actual development-path!

Things done in iBoard4 will be ported to iboard3.

Developer-Homepage is at http://ib4.iboard.cc
